The Context API is a feature specifically associated with React. It provides a mechanism to share data between components without the need to manually pass props through the component tree. This can address the issue of "prop drilling," which occurs when data needs to be passed down through many levels of the component hierarchy. However, the Context API is not designed for complex state management, and that's where libraries like Redux come into play. For React applications requiring robust state management, the recommended approach is to combine React with Redux using the react-redux library.
easiar version of Redux is Redux-toolkit(RTK).
